# Contributing to Aspen

Before submitting a pull request with code, I highly recommend opening a new [issue][issue] and checking to make sure it's something we will accept as a new feature or patch. Bug fixes are usually 100% OK, but not every feature is something that will be relevant to Aspen's goals.

### Code Guidelines

Aspen doesn't have any specific coding guidelines. Just do your best to match the existing style in the file you are working in. If you create a new file, try to match what everything else is doing. If it's not perfect, no one will lose much sleep. It can always be fixed later.

Thank you for your interest in helping with Aspen!
